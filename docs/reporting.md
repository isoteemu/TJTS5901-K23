# Weekly assignment - documentation / reporting requirements

All the code in JYU Gitlab should be well documented.
i.e. by reading your code, the reader understands what you have done based on the documentation without the need for further explanation.

In addition, create a weekly `.md` text file in `docs/` -folder, in which everyone on team will report:
 - The tasks that they have performed. Everyone on the team should do it themselves.
 - How have the team addressed top 10 web application security risks (OWASP)? Choose at least 5 most applicable.

You can use markdown syntax and link appropriate commits, merges, issues and such â€“ or not. To learn more about GitLab flavored markdown, see: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html>
